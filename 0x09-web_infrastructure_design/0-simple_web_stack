## Explanations
- **Server**: A physical or virtual machine that hosts the website’s components, processes requests, and serves content to users.
- **Domain Name**: `foobar.com` provides a user-friendly address that resolves to the server’s IP (8.8.8.8).
- **DNS Record**: The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is an A record mapping to the server’s IP (8.8.8.8).
- **Web Server (Nginx)**: Handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
- **Application Server**: Executes application logic (e.g., PHP, Python) to generate dynamic content for the website.
- **Database (MySQL)**: Stores and manages website data, such as user information or content, queried by the application server.
- **Communication Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS is used for communication between the user’s browser and the server.
- **Issues**:
  - **SPOF**: A single server means any failure (hardware, software) causes complete downtime.
  - **Downtime**: Maintenance tasks, like restarting Nginx for new code deployment, interrupt service.
  - **Scalability**: The single server cannot handle high traffic volumes, limiting scalability.
